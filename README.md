# Cybersecurity_KeyLogger (Keyboard)
Keystroke logging, often referred to as keylogging or keyboard capturing, is the action of recording the keys struck on a keyboard, typically covertly,
so that a person using the keyboard is unaware that their actions are being monitored. Data can then be retrieved by the person operating the logging program.

Keyloggers are often used as a spyware tool by cybercriminals to steal personally identifiable information (PII), login credentials and sensitive enterprise data.

Some uses of keyloggers could be considered ethical or appropriate in varying degrees. Keylogger recorders may also be used by:

1. Employers to observe employees' computer activities
2. Parents to supervise their children's internet usage
3. Device owners to track possible unauthorized activity on their devices
4. Law enforcement agencies to analyze incidents involving computer use.
